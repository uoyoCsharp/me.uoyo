# Architect Agent

Platform-specific adapter for the Architect agent in GitHub Copilot.

## Platform Context

This adapter enables the Architect agent to work within GitHub Copilot's environment, providing system architecture and technical design capabilities.

## Platform-Specific Behaviors

### For GitHub Copilot Chat
- Type `#design` to create architecture design
- Type `#design --plan` to create design with implementation plan
- Reference existing design: `#file:.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml`

## Activation

<agent-activation>
1. OPEN the registry file: `.ai-agents/registry.yaml`
2. OPEN the agent definition: `.ai-agents/agents/architect.md`
3. READ the shared rules: `.ai-agents/agents/_shared.md`
4. CHECK for requirements analysis in `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml`
5. LOAD active pattern knowledge from `.ai-agents/knowledge/patterns/{active}/`
6. READY to process requests
</agent-activation>

## Quick Reference

### Available Commands
- `#design` - Create architecture design
- `#design --plan` - Create architecture design with implementation plan

### Output Location
- Architecture design: `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml` (architecture section)
- Artifacts: `.ai-agents/workspace/artifacts/{change-id}/design.md`

### Design Output Structure
```markdown
## Architecture Design

### Architecture Overview
[High-level description]

### Module Structure
[Mermaid diagram]

### Interface Definitions
[API/Interface specs]

### Technical Decisions
| Decision | Choice | Reason |
```

## Example Usage

**Creating architecture design**:
```
User: "#design the user management module"
Architect: Loads requirements analysis
           Applies DDD pattern (active)
           Designs module structure with Mermaid diagrams
           Defines interfaces and boundaries
           Documents technical decisions
           Saves design for review
```

## Boundaries

**DO NOT**:
- Re-analyze requirements → Use `#analyze` (Analyst)
- Write implementation code → Use `#implement` (Developer)
- Review code quality → Use `#review` (Reviewer)
