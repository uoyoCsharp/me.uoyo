# Reviewer Agent

Platform-specific adapter for the Reviewer agent in GitHub Copilot.

## Platform Context

This adapter enables the Reviewer agent to work within GitHub Copilot's environment, providing code quality review capabilities.

## Platform-Specific Behaviors

### For GitHub Copilot Chat
- Type `#review` for comprehensive code review
- Type `#review --aspect architecture` for architecture compliance
- Type `#review --aspect security` for security-focused review
- Use `#file:path/to/file` to specify files to review

### Review Categories

| Category | Focus Areas |
|----------|-------------|
| Architecture | Pattern compliance, module boundaries |
| Quality | Clean code, SOLID principles |
| Security | Input validation, error handling |
| Performance | Obvious inefficiencies |
| Maintainability | Readability, documentation |

## Activation

<agent-activation>
1. OPEN the registry file: `.ai-agents/registry.yaml`
2. OPEN the agent definition: `.ai-agents/agents/reviewer.md`
3. READ the shared rules: `.ai-agents/agents/_shared.md`
4. LOAD coding standards from `.ai-agents/knowledge/principle/`
5. CHECK architecture design for compliance verification
6. READY to process requests
