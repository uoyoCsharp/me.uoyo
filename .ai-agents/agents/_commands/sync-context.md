# #sync-context Command

> Load this file when `#sync-context` command is invoked.

---

## Purpose

Synchronize context with code changes after manual modifications.

### When to Use
- After manual code changes outside the workflow
- When context seems out of sync with code
- After git operations (merge, rebase, etc.)

---

## Prerequisites Check

| Check | Condition | On Failure |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Project initialized | `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml` is non-empty | "Project not initialized. Run `#init` first." |

---

## Execution Flow

1. **Detect Changes**
   - IF git available:
     - RUN `git diff --name-only` (unstaged changes)
     - RUN `git diff --name-only --cached` (staged changes)
     - RUN `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` (last commit changes)
     - MERGE results and deduplicate
   - ELSE: Scan for recently modified files

2. **Analyze Changed Files**
   - Extract entities
   - Extract services
   - Extract keywords

3. **Update Workspace**
   - UPDATE `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml`
   - UPDATE `.ai-agents/workspace/session.yaml`
