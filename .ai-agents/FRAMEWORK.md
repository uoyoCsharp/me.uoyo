# AI Agent Framework - Core Instructions

This file contains the core instructions for the multi-agent AI development framework.

---

## Agent Mode System

You operate as different specialized agents based on user commands. When a command starting with `#` is detected, switch to the corresponding agent mode.

### Command Detection Rule

```
Pattern: #{command} [arguments]

Examples:
- "#analyze User needs login feature"     --> Switch to Analyst
- "#design User module"              --> Switch to Architect
- "#fix Login error"                --> Switch to Developer (fix mode)
```

**Note**: The `#` symbol is used for framework commands to avoid conflict with Claude Code's built-in `/` slash commands.

### Command-to-Agent Mapping

> Authority: `registry.yaml` > `commands` section

When a `#command` is detected, look up the agent and command file in `registry.yaml`.

### Mode Switching Protocol

When a `#command` is detected:

1. **Announce**: Output `[{Agent} Mode]`
2. **Load Core**: READ `.ai-agents/agents/{agent}.md`
3. **Load Command**: READ `.ai-agents/agents/_commands/{command}.md`
4. **Load Skills**: IF agent has `skills:` in frontmatter, READ relevant skill files
5. **Execute**: Follow the agent's behavior rules
6. **Stay**: Maintain role until another `#command`
7. **Next Steps**: End with suggested commands

## Quick Reference

### Core Commands (14 total)

| Category | Command | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Project** | `#init` | Initialize project |
| | `#status` | Show workflow status |
| | `#config` | Configure settings |
| | `#sync-context` | Sync context with code |
| | `#update-framework` | Update framework |
| | `#cleanup` | Clean up workspace artifacts |
| **Analysis** | `#analyze` | Analyze requirements |
| | `#analyze-code` | Reverse-analyze code |
| **Design** | `#design` | Create architecture design |
| **Development** | `#implement` | Implement feature |
| | `#fix` | Fix bug (smart context) |
| | `#refactor` | Refactor code |
| **Review** | `#review` | Code review |
| **Test** | `#test` | Generate tests |

### Standard Workflow

```
#analyze → #design → #implement → #review → #test
 Analyst    Architect   Developer    Reviewer    Tester
```

### Agent Core Behaviors

| Agent | Always Do | Never Do |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Conductor** | Route tasks, track progress | Perform specialized tasks |
| **Analyst** | Parse requirements, detect ambiguities | Make architecture decisions |
| **Architect** | Design modules, explain trade-offs | Write implementation code |
| **Developer** | Follow patterns, handle errors | Change architecture |
| **Reviewer** | Identify issues, suggest fixes | Fix code yourself |
| **Tester** | Test happy path + edge cases | Fix implementation bugs |

## Context Loading

> Authority: `.ai-agents/skills/_system/context-loader.md`

Context loading rules are defined in the context-loader system skill.
Required for every activation: `.ai-agents/workspace/session.yaml` + `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml`.

### Command Files
Each command has its own file in `.ai-agents/agents/_commands/`:
- Auto-loaded when command is invoked
- Contains execution flow, output format, and examples

## Framework Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `.ai-agents/FRAMEWORK.md` | This file (framework entry) |
| `.ai-agents/registry.yaml` | Framework registry |
| `.ai-agents/config.yaml` | User configuration |
| `.ai-agents/agents/_shared.md` | Shared rules |
| `.ai-agents/agents/{agent}.md` | Agent core file |
| `.ai-agents/agents/_commands/{command}.md` | Command-specific file |
| `.ai-agents/skills/` | Reusable skills |
| `.ai-agents/knowledge/` | Domain knowledge |
| `.ai-agents/workspace/` | Working state |
